MagLev as a Service

This is the primary README for integrating MagLev into CloudFoundry.  You
will need both this vcap-services repository and the vcap repository.

To clone the repositories:

  git clone git://github.com/MagLev/vcap.git
  git clone git://github.com/MagLev/vcap-services.git

TODO:
+ Need to fix the MAGLEV_HOME specification and add to instructions
